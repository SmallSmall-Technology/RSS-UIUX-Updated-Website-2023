            <article>
               <p class="subterm__conditions">A prospective subscriber of a property listed on the RentSmallSmall Platform is required to<br>
                 provide certain documents for verification purposes within 24 hours of reserving a <br>
                 property for subscription. The move-in date may be extended where a Subscriber is <br>
                 unable to present the required document within the above stipulated time.<br></p> 

                <p class="subterm__conditions"> Upon a satisfactory verification process, the property owner shall confirm the subscription <br>
                    of the property as reserved by the prospective subscriber. No person other than<br>
                    the property owner or his appointed agent may confirm or decline the subscription of<br>
                    a property reserved by a prospective Subscriber. Where a property owner declines a <br>
                    property reservation made by a prospective Subscriber, the property subscription will be<br>
                    cancelled immediately and the prospective subscriber may elect to let another property <br>
                    on the Platform or claim a full refund of all monies advanced via the Platform for the <br>
                    Subscription. Where a User provides invalid documents for any process on the Platform,<br>
                        Rentsmallsmall shall reject such invalid documents and extend the Move-in date for <br>
                        re-submission of the required documents by the User. The subscription of the reserved <br>
                        property will not be cancelled by Rentsmallsmall, however the Move-in date will be <br>
                        extended for up to 15 days to enable the User provide all the required documents as all<br>
                        documents shall be provided by the User no later than 48 hours before the Move-in date.<br>
                        In the event where a User is an existing Subscriber desirous to move into another listed <br>
                        property, the terms relating to documentation and property owner verification shall apply.<br>
                        However, where a listed property does not require property owner verification prior to<br>
                            Move-in by a Subscriber, the standard documentation procedure above shall apply.<br></p>

                   subscription agreement by a Subscriber will attract a termination penalty. A Subscriber<br>
                    who terminates a property subscription before the full term of the Subscription will forfeit<br>

             owner/legal representative against breach of Subscription, damages to the property, and <br>

             one month or two months of subscription fee as stated on the property details <br>
             subscription fee over the demised property. A prospective Subscriber will pay the Security<br>
              Deposit to RentSmallSmall before the commencement of the property subscription in <br>
              accordance with the property subscription agreement. Where a prospective subscriber<br>
               fails to pay the Security Deposit, the property reservation process will not be complete and<br>
                can thus not move into the property nor pay subscription fee in respect of the selected<br>
                 property. Where an existing Subscriber chooses to move into another property listed on <br>
                 the Platform, but with a higher subscription value, the difference between the current fee<br>
                  subscription fee payable by the Subscriber and the new property will be paid to <br>
                  RentSmallSmall to update the Security Deposit. The same procedure will apply where a<br>
